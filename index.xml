      <description>M.J. Tattersall is a writer and PhD academic based out of the Department of English Literature and Creative Writing at Lancaster University, UK. He is currently writing a novel about John Ruskin&amp;rsquo;s silent decade, 1890-1900, and is fascinated by Ruskin&amp;rsquo;s continuing relevance today. The novel, which is being written in part-fulfilment of M.J.&amp;rsquo;s doctoral research, explores neo-Victorian and epistolary fiction&amp;rsquo;s relevance to notions of s√©ance as well as their links to the prophetic biblical patterning of Ruskin&amp;rsquo;s own works.</description>

      <description>Hello. Welcome to my website. Here you will find information relating to my work as a novelist and academic. Please feel free to check out my professional links, and posts containing updates on my work to date.
The site is completely barebones at the minute as I am in the (very slow) process of creating a website with no prior coding experiences. All languages are beautiful&amp;ndash;even computer-speak&amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s always hard work learning new ones.</description>
